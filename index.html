        <p>Brian K. Wisniewski, 45, of Philadelphia, PA passed away on Friday, September 9, 2016, in his home.</p>
        <p>Brian grew up in the Frankford neighborhood of Philadelphia and graduated Holy Ghost Preparatory School. He was an organizer from a young age: whether throwing events on behalf of Funkadelphia, running businesses like Miracle Wash, bringing out votes as a Democratic Committeeman, organizing protests at the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, or uniting neighbors as the President of Frankford Civic Association, Brian had a knack for bringing people together.</p>
        <p>Brian had an impressive presence throughout the city, by way of rooftops, billboards, trucks, bridges, and trains. Those who knew how to look were impressed by his gall and artistic ability. Those who had the privilege to know him will remember his loyalty to family and friends, his penchant for persuasion, his persistent sense of humor, and desire to help others.</p>
        <p>Brian is survived by his proud parents, Regina (Gower) and Dr. Charles Wisniewski, his brother Tim, his sister Katie, and many loving cousins, aunts, and uncles. Brian's family will receive relatives and friends on Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016 from 10 to 12 noon at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church, 611 Knowles Ave, Southampton, PA. A Mass will be celebrated at 12 noon.  Interment will be private. In lieu of flowers, the Wisniewski family has requested donations in Brian's name to a charity of your choice.
